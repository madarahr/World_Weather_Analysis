## Outline of Analysis

A pop up marker was layered on top of the google maps which have all the cities selected earlier to instantly provide the weather conditions, latitude, longitude and hotel information.  Four cities were then selected to build an itinerary based on the customer's feedback and within the same continent.  Based on the travel mode which was driving, the itinerary was build with a route between the 4 selected cities.  The route was then layered onto the maps to enable a visual outlook of the trip.
